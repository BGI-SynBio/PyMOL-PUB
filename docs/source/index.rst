Structural bioinformatics is a vital field within bioinformatics, focused on the analysis and prediction of
the 3-dimensional structure of biological molecules, including proteins, RNA, and DNA.
As a key bridge between structural biology and bioinformatics, structural visualization tools play a crucial role
in advancing the field by providing visualization of structural information.
The current process of creating publication-quality figures can be time-consuming for structural biologists,
as no useful tool is currently available for generating figures directly from structure data.
Therefore, the integration of end-to-end visual interfaces becomes a pressing necessity.

We have developed an open-source tool of PyMOL framework, named PyMOL-PUB,
to streamline the creation of publication-quality figures from molecular structure data.
This extension offers a range of features, including structural alignment methods,
functional coloring schemes, conformation adjustments, and layout plotting strategies.
These functions enable users to easily and rapidly generate publication-quality figures that
highlight structural differences (or variations), showcase the connections between physicochemical properties
and molecular structures, and/or illustrate inter-molecular interactions.

To summarize, we believe that PyMOL-PUB provides users with a flexible platform to
efficiently construct high-resolution figures for customized visualization,
driving the rapid advancement of structural biology.
